To start, we'll be making a project that has a basic login form that allows for a fixed set of users to log in and log out.

 

In Spring Tools, create a new Spring Starter project:

Name: authentication

Java Version: 8

Group: com.tts

Artifact: authentication

Description: Authentication demo

Package Name: com.tts.authentication

Dependencies: Thymeleaf, Spring Web, Spring Security
